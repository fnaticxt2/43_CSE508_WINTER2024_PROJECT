76,Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer,Principal Verification Engineer - Compute Subsystem Verification,Arm,"Bengaluru, Karnataka, India",22:59:45,12 hours ago,"About the job
Job Description

The need for specialized compute everywhere has driven a shift away from a one-size-fits-all market approach. A new approach to specialized compute platform development is required to meet this growing demand. Arm Advanced Compute Subsystems for Neoverse deliver a world-class performance of the latest Arm CPUs and system IP on leading-edge technology.

Our Verification team verifies Arm IPs and subsystems for various application segments. We are looking for creative and enthusiastic Verification Engineers with knowledge of subsystems and SoCs to help verify these subsystems. You will join a small team of dedicated engineers in Bangalore and contribute to the verification of various compute subsystems

Responsibilities

As part of the team, you will push Arm CPUs, system IPs, and the Subsystem to their functional limits – targeting the IP's internal architecture and how it interacts with the rest of the system.

The role involves developing and running soak tests based on Arm architecture and the IP design, and debugging hardware and software failures in the CPU or the IP and the system around it.

You will work with cross-site design teams, discuss requirements, build test plans, develop tests targeting corner cases, and collaborate to achieve verification goals.

Have you worked on verifying either CPUs or other IPs in a system or a Subsystem, and have a strong technical background? Then, you are the right match for this job!

Required Skills And Experience

12+ years of proven experience in verification of CPU, system IPs, and compute Subsystems.

Understanding of CPU or SoC architecture and its verification
Experience in system testing using linux based benchmark tools or tests.
Good in logical programming using C/C++/assembly
Awareness of CPU architecture features (such as caches, MMU, SMP, coherency, and CPU pipelines)
General understanding of Arm-based systems and protocols like AHB, AXI, ACE, or CHI
Proficiency in problem-solving and debugging
Proven track record of driving project execution and delivery

“Nice To Have” Skills and Experience 

Familiarity with hardware acceleration platforms like Emulation
Knowledge of industry standard interconnect protocol likes PCIe, UCIe and CXL
